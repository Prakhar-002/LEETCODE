# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### Table: `Delivery`


| Column Name                 | Type    |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |

delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.</br>
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).

---

### If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

### The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

### Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.

### The result format is in the following example.

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ The customer id 1 has a first order with delivery id 1 and it is scheduled.</br> The customer id 2 has a first order with delivery id 2 and it is immediate.</br> The customer id 3 has a first order with delivery id 5 and it is scheduled.</br> The customer id 4 has a first order with delivery id 7 and it is immediate.</br> Hence, half the customers have immediate first orders.
