# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### Table: `Customer`

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |

In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.</br>
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.</br>
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.</br>
amount is the total paid by a customer.

---

### You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

### Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). `average_amount` should be rounded to two decimal places.

### Return the result table ordered by `visited_on` in ascending order.

### The result format is in the following example.
