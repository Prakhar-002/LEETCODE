# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### Table: `Customer`

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |

In SQL,(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.</br>
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.</br>
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) has visited the restaurant.</br>
amount is the total paid by a customer.

---

### You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).

### Compute the moving average of how much the customer paid in a seven days window (i.e., current day + 6 days before). `average_amount` should be rounded to two decimal places.

### Return the result table ordered by `visited_on` in ascending order.

### The result format is in the following example.

</br>

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ Customer table:

| customer_id | name    | visited_on | amount |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------- | ------ |
| 1           | Jhon    | 2019-01-01 | 100    |
| 2           | Daniel  | 2019-01-02 | 110    |
| 3           | Jade    | 2019-01-03 | 120    |
| 4           | Khaled  | 2019-01-04 | 130    |
| 5           | Winston | 2019-01-05 | 110    |

| 3           | Jade    | 2019-01-10 | 150    |

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤

| visited_on | amount | average_amount |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------- |
| 2019-01-07 | 860    | 122.86         |
| 2019-01-08 | 840    | 120            |
| 2019-01-09 | 840    | 120            |
| 2019-01-10 | 1000   | 142.86         |

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ </br> 1st moving average from 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-07 has an average_amount of (100 + 110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150)/7 = 122.86</br> 2nd moving average from 2019-01-02 to 2019-01-08 has an average_amount of (110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80)/7 = 120</br> 3rd moving average from 2019-01-03 to 2019-01-09 has an average_amount of (120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110)/7 = 120</br> 4th moving average from 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-10 has an average_amount of (130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110 + 130 + 150)/7 = 142.86
