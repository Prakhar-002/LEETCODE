# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ Stadium table:

| id   | visit_date | people    |
|------+------------+-----------|
| 1    | 2017-01-01 | 10        |
| 2    | 2017-01-02 | 109       |
| 3    | 2017-01-03 | 150       |
| 4    | 2017-01-04 | 99        |
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188       |

</br>

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤

| id   | visit_date | people    |
|------+------------+-----------|
| 5    | 2017-01-05 | 145       |
| 6    | 2017-01-06 | 1455      |
| 7    | 2017-01-07 | 199       |
| 8    | 2017-01-09 | 188       |

</br>

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤
  ### The four rows with ids 5, 6, 7, and 8 have consecutive ids and each of them has >= 100 people attended. Note that row 8 was included even though the visit_date was not the next day after row 7.
  ### The rows with ids 2 and 3 are not included because we need at least three consecutive ids.
