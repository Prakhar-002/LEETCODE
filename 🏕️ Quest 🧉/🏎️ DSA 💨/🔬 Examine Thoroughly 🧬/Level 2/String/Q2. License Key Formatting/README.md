# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### You are given a license key represented as a string `s` that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.

### We want to reformat the string `s` such that each group contains exactly `k` characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than `k` but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

### Return the reformatted license key.

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ "5F3Z-2E9W"

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters. Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.

</br>

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ "2-5G-3J"

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.

</br>

# Constraints 🔒 ˋ°•*⁀➷

🔹 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup> </br>
🔹 s consists of English letters, digits, and dashes '-'. </br>
🔹 1 <= k <= 10<sup>4</sup> </br>
