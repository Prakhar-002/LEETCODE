            # `periods` accumulates the total count. It's initialized to 1 to account
            # for the first single-element subarray (prices[0]).

                  # Add the length of the current streak (`prev`) to the total.
                  # This works because a streak of length `k` adds `k` new subarrays
                  # that end at the current position.
