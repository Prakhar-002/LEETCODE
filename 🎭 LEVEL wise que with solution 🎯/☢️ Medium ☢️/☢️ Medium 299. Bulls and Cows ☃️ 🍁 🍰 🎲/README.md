</h2>

</br>

# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### You're playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend. You, as the game master, have written down a secret number. Your friend must guess that number.

### When your friend makes a guess, you give them a hint with the following information:

- **Bulls:** The number of digits in the guess that are in the correct position (i.e., they match the corresponding digit in the secret number).
- **Cows:** The number of digits in the guess that are present in your secret number but are located in the *wrong* position. This means the digits in the guess (excluding the "bulls") could be rearranged to become "bulls".

### Your task is, given the `secret` number and your friend's `guess`, to return the formatted hint as a string in the form "xAyB", where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. It's important to note that both `secret` and `guess` can contain duplicate digits.

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ secret = "1807", guess = "7810"

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ "1A3B"

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:

"1807"
  |
"7810"

</br>

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ secret = "1123", guess = "0111"

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ "1A1B"

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:

"1123"        "1123"
  |      or     |
"0111"        "0111"
Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.

</br>

# Constraints 🔒 ˋ°•*⁀➷

🔹 1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000 </br>

🔹 secret.length == guess.length </br>

🔹 secret and guess consist of digits only. </br>
