# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### Given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`, return *the number of strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays*.

</br>

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤  words1 = ["leetcode","is","amazing","as","is"], words2 = ["amazing","leetcode","is"]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 2

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ ➺

    ➺ "leetcode" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. 
        We count this string.

    ➺ "amazing" appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. 
        We count this string.

    ➺ "is" appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. 
        We do not count this string.

    ➺ "as" appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. 
        We do not count this string.

    Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.
</br>

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ words1 = ["b","bb","bbb"], words2 = ["a","aa","aaa"]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 0

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.
