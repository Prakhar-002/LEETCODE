# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. The objective is to find a subsequence of `nums` that satisfies the following conditions:

- The subsequence must have a length of `k`.
- The subsequence must have the largest possible sum amongst all subsequences of length `k`.

### Your task is to return *any* such subsequence that meets these requirements, represented as an integer array of length `k`.

### Recall that a subsequence is derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

</br>

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ [3,3]

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.

</br>

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ nums = [-1,-2,3,4], k = 3

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ [-1,3,4]

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ The subsequence has the largest sum of -1 + 3 + 4 = 6.

</br>

# Example 💡 3️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ nums = [3,4,3,3], k = 2

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ [3,4]

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 4 = 7.
Another possible subsequence is [4, 3].

# Constraints 🔒 ˋ°•*⁀➷

🔹 1 <= nums.length <= 1000 </br>

🔹 -10<sup>5</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup> </br>

🔹 1 <= k <= nums.length </br>
