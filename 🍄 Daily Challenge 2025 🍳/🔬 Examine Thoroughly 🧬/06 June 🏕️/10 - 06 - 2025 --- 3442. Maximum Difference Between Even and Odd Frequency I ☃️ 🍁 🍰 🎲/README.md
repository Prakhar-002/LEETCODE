# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### You are given a string `s` containing only lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the maximum difference `diff = a1 - a2` between the frequency of two characters, `a1` and `a2`, within the string `s`, subject to the following constraints:

1. The character `a1` must have an *odd* frequency in the string.
2. The character `a2` must have an *even* frequency in the string.

Return the maximum possible value of this difference `diff`.

</br>

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ s = "aaaaabbc"

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 3

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2. </br> The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.

</br>

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ s = "abcabcab"

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 1

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2. </br> The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.

</br>

# Constraints 🔒 ˋ°•*⁀➷

🔹 3 <= s.length <= 100 </br>

🔹 s consists only of lowercase English letters. </br>

🔹 s contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency. </br>
