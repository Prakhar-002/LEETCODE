### Alice and Bob are playing a turn-based game on a field, with two lanes of flowers between them. There are x flowers in the first lane between Alice and Bob, and y flowers in the second lane between them.

### The game proceeds as follows:

### Alice takes the first turn.

  - In each turn, a player must choose either one of the lane and pick one flower from that side.
  - At the end of the turn, if there are no flowers left at all, the current player captures their opponent and wins the game.
  - Given two integers, n and m, the task is to compute the number of possible pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions:

###  Alice must win the game according to the described rules.

  - The number of flowers x in the first lane must be in the range [1,n].
  - The number of flowers y in the second lane must be in the range [1,m].
  - Return the number of possible pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions mentioned in the statement.

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ `n = 3, m = 2`

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 3

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ The following pairs satisfy conditions described in the statement: (1,2), (3,2), (2,1).

</br>

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ `n = 1, m = 1`

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 0

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ No pairs satisfy the conditions described in the statement.

</br>

# Example 💡 3️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ `n = 5, m = 5`

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 12

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ The valid pairs (x, y) where Alice wins are: (1,2), (1,4), (2,1), (3,2), (3,4), (4,1), (2,3), (4,3), (1, 2), (2,1), (3,2), (2,3)
