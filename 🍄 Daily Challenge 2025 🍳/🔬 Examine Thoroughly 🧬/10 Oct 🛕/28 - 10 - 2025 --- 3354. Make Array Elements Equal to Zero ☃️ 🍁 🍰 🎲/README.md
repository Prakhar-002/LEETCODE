# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### You are given an integer array `nums`.

### Start by selecting a starting position `curr` such that `nums[curr] == 0`, and choose a movement direction of either left or right.

### After that, you repeat the following process:

- If `curr` is out of the range `[0, n - 1]`, this process ends.
- If `nums[curr] == 0`, move in the current direction by incrementing `curr` if you are moving right, or decrementing `curr` if you are moving left.
- Else if `nums[curr] > 0`:
  - Decrement `nums[curr]` by 1.
  - Reverse your movement direction (left becomes right and vice versa).
  - Take a step in your new direction.

### A selection of the initial position `curr` and movement direction is considered valid if every element in `nums` becomes 0 by the end of the process.

### Return the number of possible valid selections.

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ `nums = [1,0,2,0,3]`

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ `2`

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ ➺

  - The only possible valid selections are the following:
    - Choose `curr = 3`, and a movement direction to the left.
      - `[1,0,2,0,3] -> [1,0,2,0,3] -> [1,0,1,0,3] -> [1,0,1,0,3] -> [1,0,1,0,2] -> [1,0,1,0,2] -> [1,0,0,0,2] -> [1,0,0,0,2] -> [1,0,0,0,1] -> [1,0,0,0,1] -> [1,0,0,0,1] -> [1,0,0,0,1] -> [0,0,0,0,1] -> [0,0,0,0,1] -> [0,0,0,0,1] -> [0,0,0,0,1] -> [0,0,0,0,0]`.
    - Choose `curr = 3`, and a movement direction to the right.
      - `[1,0,2,0,3] -> [1,0,2,0,3] -> [1,0,2,0,2] -> [1,0,2,0,2] -> [1,0,1,0,2] -> [1,0,1,0,2] -> [1,0,1,0,1] -> [1,0,1,0,1] -> [1,0,0,0,1] -> [1,0,0,0,1] -> [1,0,0,0,0] -> [1,0,0,0,0] -> [1,0,0,0,0] -> [1,0,0,0,0] -> [0,0,0,0,0]`.

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ `nums = [2,3,4,0,4,1,0]`

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ `0`

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ ➺

  - There are no possible valid selections.

</br>

# Constraints 🔒 ˋ°•*⁀➷

🔹 `1 <= nums.length <= 100` </br>
🔹 `0 <= nums[i] <= 100` </br>
🔹 There is at least one element `i` where `nums[i] == 0`. </br>
