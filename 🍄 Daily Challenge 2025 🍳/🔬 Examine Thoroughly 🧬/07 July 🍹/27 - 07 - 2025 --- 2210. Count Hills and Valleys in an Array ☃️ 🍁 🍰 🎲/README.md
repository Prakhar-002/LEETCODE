# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. Your task is to count the number of hills and valleys in `nums`.

### Definitions:

- A peak element (or hill) is an element at index `i` that is strictly greater than its closest non-equal neighbors.
- A valley is an element at index `i` that is strictly smaller than its closest non-equal neighbors.
- Adjacent indices `i` and `j` are part of the *same* hill or valley if `nums[i] == nums[j]`.

### Important notes:

- To be considered a hill or valley, an index must have a non-equal neighbor *both* to its left and right.

### Your function should return the total number of distinct hills and valleys in the given array `nums`.

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ nums = [2,4,1,1,6,5]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 3

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤
- Index 0: No non-equal neighbor on the left. Not a hill/valley.
- Index 1: Neighbors are 2 and 1. 4 > 2 and 4 > 1, so it's a hill.
- Index 2: Neighbors are 4 and 6. 1 < 4 and 1 < 6, so it's a valley.
- Index 3: Neighbors are 4 and 6. It's part of the *same* valley as index 2.
- Index 4: Neighbors are 1 and 5. 6 > 1 and 6 > 5, so it's a hill.
- Index 5: No non-equal neighbor on the right. Not a hill/valley.

There are 3 distinct hills and valleys in `nums`: one hill at index 1, one valley spanning indices 2 and 3, and another hill at index 4.

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ nums = [6,6,5,5,4,1]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 0

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤
- Index 0: No non-equal neighbor on the left.
- Index 1: No non-equal neighbor on the left.
- Index 2: Neighbors are 6 and 4. 5 < 6 and 5 > 4, so not a hill/valley.
- Index 3: Neighbors are 6 and 4. 5 < 6 and 5 > 4, so not a hill/valley.
- Index 4: Neighbors are 5 and 1. 4 < 5 and 4 > 1, so not a hill/valley.
- Index 5: No non-equal neighbor on the right.

There are 0 hills and valleys.
