# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.

### You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

### Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit*, return `0`.

</br>

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 5

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.</br> Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

</br>

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ prices = [7,6,4,3,1]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 0

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
