# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### You are given a `m x n` 2D binary grid called `grid` that represents a map. In this grid, '1's represent land, while '0's represent water.

### An "island" is defined as a group of connected land cells, surrounded by water. Two land cells are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally). You can assume that all four edges of the grid are effectively surrounded by water.

### Your task is to return the total number of islands present in the given `grid`.
