# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle, meaning the first and last houses are neighbors. Adjacent houses have a connected security system, which alerts the police if two adjacent houses are robbed on the same night. 

### Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money in each house, return the maximum amount you can rob without alerting the police.

</br>

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ `nums = [2,3,2]`

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 3

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ ➺ You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses. The optimal strategy is to rob house 2 (money=3).

</br>

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ `nums = [1,2,3,1]`

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 4

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3). Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

</br>

# Example 💡 3️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ `nums = [1,2,3]`

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 3

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ Rob house 3 and amount looted=3. Another strategy to rob house number 2. This yields 2 amount. Therefore maximum will be looting 3.
