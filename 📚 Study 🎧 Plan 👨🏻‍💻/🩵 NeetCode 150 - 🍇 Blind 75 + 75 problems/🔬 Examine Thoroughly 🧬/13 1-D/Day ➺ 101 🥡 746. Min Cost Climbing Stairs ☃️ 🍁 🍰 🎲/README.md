# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### You are presented with a staircase represented by an integer array `cost`. Each `cost[i]` indicates the cost of taking the i<sup>th</sup> step on the staircase. Once you pay this cost, you have the option to climb either one or two steps upward.

### You are free to start from either the step at index 0 or the step at index 1.

### The task is to return the *minimum* total cost to reach the "top" of the staircase (i.e., to surpass the last step in the array).

</br>

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ cost = [10,15,20]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 15

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ You will start at index 1.

- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.

The total cost is 15.

</br>

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 6

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ You will start at index 0.
