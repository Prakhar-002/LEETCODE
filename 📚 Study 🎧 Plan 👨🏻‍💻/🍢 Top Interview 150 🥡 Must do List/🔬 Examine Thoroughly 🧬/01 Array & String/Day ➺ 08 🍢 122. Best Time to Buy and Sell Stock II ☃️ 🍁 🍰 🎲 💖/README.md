# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i<sup>th</sup> day.

### On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

### Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 7

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.</br> Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.</br> Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

</br>

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤  prices = [1,2,3,4,5]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 4

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.</br> Total profit is 4.

</br>

# Example 💡 3️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ prices = [7,6,4,3,1]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 0

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
