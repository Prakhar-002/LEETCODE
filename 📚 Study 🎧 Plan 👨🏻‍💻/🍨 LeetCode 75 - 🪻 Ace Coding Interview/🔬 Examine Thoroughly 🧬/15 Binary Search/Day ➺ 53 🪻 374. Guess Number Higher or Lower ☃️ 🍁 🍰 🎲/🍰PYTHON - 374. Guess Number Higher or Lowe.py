            left = 1                   # Initialize the left boundary to 1 (since guessing starts from 1)

                  result = guess(mid)  # Call the guess API with mid value

                  if result == 0:

                        right = mid - 1  # Target number is smaller, move left
                  else:
                        left = mid + 1   # Target number is bigger, move right

            return -1  # Should not reach here if guess always returns correct result
