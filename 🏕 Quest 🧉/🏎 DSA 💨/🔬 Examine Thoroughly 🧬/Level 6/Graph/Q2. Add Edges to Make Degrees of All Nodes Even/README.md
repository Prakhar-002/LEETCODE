# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### There is an **undirected graph** consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `1` to `n`. You are given the integer `n` and a 2D array `edges` where `edges[i] = [aᵢ, bᵢ]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `aᵢ` and `bᵢ`. The graph can be **disconnected**.

- You can add **at most two additional edges** (possibly none) to this graph.
- The added edges must **not** create repeated edges and must **not** be self-loops (i.e., an edge from a node to itself is not allowed).
- The **degree** of a node is the number of edges connected to it.

### Your task is to **return `true`** if it is possible to make the degree of **each node** in the graph **even** by adding at most two edges, otherwise return **`false`**.

### 📥 `Input`  ➤ `n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,2],[1,4],[2,5]]`

### 📤 `Output`  ➤ `true`

### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ There exists a way to add one extra edge (for example, between two nodes of odd degree) so that every node in the resulting graph has an even degree.

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

<img width="471" height="141" alt="2508 que 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bf9313d-755b-47fc-9325-7ff64a3ab9ec" />

### 📥 `Input` ➤ `n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[3,4]]`

### 📤 `Output`  ➤ `true`

### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ It is possible to add two edges (for example, connecting `1–3` and `2–4`) so that all nodes end up with even degree.

</br>

# Example 💡 3️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

<img width="191" height="201" alt="2508 que 3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b041c5aa-3538-4171-b7a0-762729171659" />

### 📥 `Input` ➤ `n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]]`

### 📤 `Output`  ➤ `false`

### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ Nodes `1, 2, 3, 4` all have odd degree, and it is **not** possible to make all degrees even by adding at most two edges without creating repeated edges or self-loops.

</br>

# Constraints 🔒 ˋ°•*⁀➷

🔹 `3 <= n <= 10^5` </br>
🔹 `2 <= edges.length <= 10^5` </br>
🔹 `edges[i].length == 2` </br>
🔹 `1 <= aᵢ, bᵢ <= n` </br>
🔹 `aᵢ != bᵢ` </br>
🔹 There are **no repeated edges**. </br>
