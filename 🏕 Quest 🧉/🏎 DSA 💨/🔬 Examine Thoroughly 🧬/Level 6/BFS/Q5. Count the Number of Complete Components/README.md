</h2>

</br>

# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

You are given an **integer** `n`, representing the number of vertices in an **undirected graph** numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

Additionally, you are given a **2D integer array** `edges`, where `edges[i] = [aᵢ, bᵢ]` denotes an **undirected edge** between vertices `aᵢ` and `bᵢ`.

### 🔹 Task:

- Return the **number of complete connected components** in the graph.
- A **connected component** is a subgraph where there exists a path between **any two vertices**, and **no vertex** is connected to a vertex outside the subgraph.
- A **complete connected component** is one where **every pair of vertices** is directly connected by an edge.

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4]]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 3

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ ➺ From the picture above, one can see that all of the components of this graph are complete.

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dba9a820-1c36-474c-8c57-b7032a72bc5a" width="414px" height="166.88px" />

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[3,4],[3,5]]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 1

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ The component containing vertices 0, 1, and 2 is complete since there is an edge between every pair of two vertices. On the other hand, the component containing vertices 3, 4, and 5 is not complete since there is no edge between vertices 4 and 5. Thus, the number of complete components in this graph is 1.

</br>

# Example 💡 3️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 0

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤  There is one connected component consisting of nodes 0, 1, and 2. However, the component is incomplete, as node 0 and 2 are not connected. Therefore, the result is 0.

</br>

# Constraints 🔒 ˋ°•*⁀➷

🔹 `1 <= n <= 50` </br>
🔹 `0 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2` </br>
🔹 `edges[i].length == 2` </br>
🔹 0 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> <= n - 1 </br>
🔹 a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub> </br>
🔹 There are no repeated edges. </br>
