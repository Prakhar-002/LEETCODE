#  ? Time complexity -> O(1)

#  ? Space complexity -> O(1) 

class Solution:
      def findCenter(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
            # We have n edge of star with two node only 
            # so concept is take an any two edge and find the common element of them

            # First node of our first edge
            starFirstNode = edges[0][0]
            # second node of our first edge
            starSecondNode = edges[0][1]

            # first Node of first edge will be =>

            # either equal to first node of any second edge (let say 2nd edge)
            if (starFirstNode == edges[1][0]):
                  return starFirstNode
            

            # or equal to second node of any second edge (let say 2nd edge)
            elif (starFirstNode == edges[1][1]):
                  return starFirstNode
            

            # And if first node is not common is both edge second Node will common for sure
            else:
                  return starSecondNode
