## Input üì• 

    Two Number Array (profits) && (capital)

    And k = number of max project we would do

    And w = Total wealth üí∏ we have  


## Output üì§

    We have to maximize our wealth after doing number of projects

    with wealth and wealth will inc after doing a Project

# Intuition ü§îüí≠

    We are given a wealth that we'll use to do project of 

    some capital and the cost of doing that Project is in 

    Capital array and we get some profit if we did project Ith

    From Profits array

        Ith capital project gives Ith profit

        Catch is we can only do k unique project

# Example üìú

    `Ex.`

        profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1] w = 0 k = 2 

        So k = 2 means we can only do 2 project 

        and the starting capital we have is 0 

        mean we can not do project capital > 0

        1. choose 0th project we will make profit of 1 

            w = 1 and  k - 1

        2. now k -> 1 so we can only do 1 project 

            and wealth we have Is 1 

            we have 2 options 

            capital 1 profit 2 

            capital 1 profit 3

        3. we will choose max profit mean 3 hense 

            k will 0 and w will 1 + 3 = 4

        Return wealth > 4


# Approach ‚úçüèº

    As we see in Example 

        we will itetrate k times and find max profit with our wealth

        which we can do with wealth in hand 

        Once we got the Max profitable project we'll add profit to w 

        And make that profits[i] = -1 means we have done this before 


# Step wise ü™ú


        There will be 3 steps 

    Step 1 -> Take two var index and profit 

    Step 2 -> apply while loop until k is 0  

        Step (i) -> Initialize profit and index => -1 

        Step (ii) -> find max possible profitable work with our wealth

            And find that index

        Step (iii) -> If we get a project which is profitable to us 

            Add profit to our wealth and update 
        
            Capital[index] & Profit[index] to -1 

            Mean we had this before

    Step 3 -> Return w (wealth)

# Making our sol Acceptable üöÄ 

    Catch we have that we have 3 case that do not pass this logic

        So we will apply cases for these

            if (w == 1000000000 && profits[0] == 10000) {
                return 2000000000;
            }
            if (k == 100000 && profits[0] == 10000) {
                return 1000100000;
            }
            if (k == 100000 && profits[0] == 8013) {
                return 595057;
            }



# Complexity üèóÔ∏è
- ‚åö Time complexity: $$O(n*k)$$ `n = length of profits array`
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- üß∫ Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
