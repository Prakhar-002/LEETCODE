# Todo ðŸ“Œ QUESTION NUMBER 1701

#? âŒš Time complexity -> O(n) ðŸ‘‰ Total customers 

#? ðŸ§º Space complexity -> O(1)

            curTime = 0
            totalTime = 0

            for arrivalTime, orderTime in customers:

                  if curTime > arrivalTime:
                        # so customer will wait extra time 
                        # extra will be current time - arrival time
                        # cause current time is that time when chef prepared one order
                        totalTime += curTime - arrivalTime

                  else :

                        # curTime will be equal to the arrival time
                        curTime = arrivalTime

                  # Total time will update by time took to made a dish of previous customer
                  totalTime += orderTime
