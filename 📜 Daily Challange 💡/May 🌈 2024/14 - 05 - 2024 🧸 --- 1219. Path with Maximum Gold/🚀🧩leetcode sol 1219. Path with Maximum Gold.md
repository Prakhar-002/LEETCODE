# Intuition 🤔
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->

    It's a simple que... let me explain ---

1. We need to `collect max gold` from our `goldmine` in one go by any road . . . Yes `we are too rich ` 😂😂

2. Condition is `we can't go where is 0 gold`.

3. *We'll collect same gold which is tha value of our grid*.

4. We can walk one step to the `left, right, up, or down`.

5. `Ex.` 
    ```
        [[0,6,5],
        [5,8,7],
        [0,9,0]]

        In this grid we'll start from 
            9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 5 -> 6
                    OR
            6 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
        Total will be = 35
    ```

# Approach 😉
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
    Basically 2 approach we have

1. `Grid with only gold` 🤩🤩 ---

    - We'll apply `2 for loop` and add every value
    ```
        public int gridWithNoZeros(int[][] grid) {
            int gold = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                    // check our goldMine contain only Gold
                    if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                        return -1;
                    } else
                        gold += grid[i][j];
                }
            }
            return gold;
        }
    
    ```
    - In main function we'll `check for -1` else return gold

    ```
        int Gold = gridWithNoZeros(grid);
        if (Gold != -1){
            return Gold;
        }
    ```

2. `Gold but distorted` 🫤🫤 ---

    - `Main DFS theory` ...

    ```
        public int dfs(int grid[][], int row, int col) {
            return 0 
             If row is less than 0
             If row is greater than length - 1
             If col is less than 0
             If col is greater than length - 1
             If grid value is 0

            // Main work

            First we will make our grid value 0 
            because we can not go back  
            
            Take value of upmost from our DFS  ( row, col - 1 )
            Take value of rightmost from our DFS  ( row + 1, col )
            Take value of downMost from our DFS  ( row, col + 1 )
            Take value of Leftmost from our DFS  ( row - 1, col )

            Assign the main value to our grid which we had chanced

            at last take the max value from up, down, left, right 
            * add with self value and return 
        }
    ```

    - In main function we'll `apply 2 for loop` and take the max gold from every possible path.
    ```
        int maxGold = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                    int gold = dfs(grid, i, j);
                    maxGold = Math.max(maxGold, gold);
                }
            }
        }
    ```

    - `Finally return maxGold`
