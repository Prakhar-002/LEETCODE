# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are given a 2D integer array classes, where classes[i] = [pass<sup>i</sup>, total<sup>i</sup>]. You know beforehand that in the i<sup>th</sup> class, there are total<sup>i</sup> total students, but only pass<sup>i</sup> number of students will pass the exam.

###  You are also given an integer `extraStudents`. There are another `extraStudents` brilliant students that are `guaranteed` to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of the `extraStudents` students to a class in a way that `maximizes` the `average` pass ratio across `all` the classes.

###  The `pass ratio` of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam divided by the total number of students of the class. The `average pass ratio` is the sum of pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.
 
###  Return *the maximum possible average pass ratio after assigning the `extraStudents` students. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted*.

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ classes = [[1,2],[3,5],[2,2]], extraStudents = 2

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 0.78333

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ You can assign the two extra students to the first class. The average pass ratio will be equal to (3/4 + 3/5 + 2/2) / 3 = 0.78333.

</br>

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ classes = [[2,4],[3,9],[4,5],[2,10]], extraStudents = 4

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 0.53485
