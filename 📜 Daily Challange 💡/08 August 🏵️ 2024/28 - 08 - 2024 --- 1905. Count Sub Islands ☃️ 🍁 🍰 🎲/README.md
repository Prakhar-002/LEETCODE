</h2>

</br>

# Description 📜 ˋ°•*⁀➷

### You are given two `m x n` binary matrices `grid1` and `grid2` containing only `0's` (representing water) and `1's` (representing land). An island is a group of` 1's` connected `4-directionally` (horizontal or vertical). Any cells outside of the grid are considered water cells.

### An island in `grid2` is considered a `sub-island` if there is an island in `grid1` that contains `all` the cells that make up `this` island in `grid2`.

### Return *the `number` of islands in `grid2` that are considered `sub-islands`*.

</br>

# Example 💡 1️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input`  ➤ grid1 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,1,1]], grid2 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,0],[1,0,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0]]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 3

  ### 🔦 `Explanation`  ➤ ➺ In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.</br> The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are three sub-islands.

</br>

# Example 💡 2️⃣ ˋ°•*⁀➷

  ### 📥 `Input` ➤ grid1 = [[1,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0,1]], grid2 = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0,1]]

  ### 📤 `Output`  ➤ 2

  ### 🔦 `Explanation` ➤ In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.</br> The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are two sub-islands.

</br>

# Constraints 🔒 ˋ°•*⁀➷

🔹 **`m == grid1.length == grid2.length`** </br>

🔹 **`n == grid1[i].length == grid2[i].length`** </br>

🔹 **`1 <= m, n <= 500`** </br>

🔹 **`grid1[i][j]` and `grid2[i][j]` are either `0` or `1`.** </br>
